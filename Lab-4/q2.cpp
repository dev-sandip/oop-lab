// Write a program that has a class with a dynamically allocated character array as its data member. One object should contain "Engineers are" and another should contain " Creatures of logic". Member function join() should concatenate two strings by passing two objects as arguments. Display the concatenated string through a member function. Use constructors to allocate and initialize the data member. Also, write a destructor to free the allocated memory for the character array. Make your own function for the concatenation of two strings.
